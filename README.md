# Project-One


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. [ The project was based around the display of a coffee maker clock the problem was solving the display time to make it set the right time and have it read hours and minutes and also being functional ]
What did you do particularly well? [ I wrote the code well from the comments I had recieved. ]
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? [ MY code could have been better if I exported the project in CPP versus in Java. It makes a huge different when coding in the right format.]
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network? [ Project One code had to be the easiest of the three for the term writting in CPP but starting off each code seems to be a challenge for me because I know what the end result should be and what it should do but starting off going in order with a psuedocode or flow chart makes things so much fluent for me ]
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work? [ Knowledge of how to make an effeicent flowchart honestly is the best thing for me that I've learned ]
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? [ For me I made sure I had comments throughout the entire code so not only someone can check it but also so that I can keep up with why I made the decision to write the code the way I did. ]
